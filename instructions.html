                <h3>Viewing</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the FootViz application. This app demonstrates how multi-faceted data may be visualised over time. In this case the setting is sports data
                    associated with a football team that denotes how they fared over a whole season. The framework may be equally applied to many other differing forms of data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the page first loads you'll see a collection of data attributes and how they vary over time. You can use the mouse buttons to move around the scene and get
                    a different view of the data - the left mouse rotates, the middle mouse button
                    pans around and the mouse wheel enables zooming in and out of the scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of the different rows of data illustrates a particular attribute associated with the football team and they are labelled at the bottom end of each row (results,
                    goals scored, goals conceeded, position in the league and cumulative points total). Each individual column has the respective value of the data displayed directly
                    above it so as to give further context. If you zoom in you should be able to see the results for the team over a given period. if you hover the
                    mouse over any of the results columns you will see the actual score of that match (as illustrated below).
                </p>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/footInstruct1.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>
                    The visibility of each data attribute may be toggled accordingly. If you select the Data option from the GUI on the right-hand side you will see a tick box next to
                    each attribute. Checking or unchecking the box will show/hide the data respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the data has been laid out for us chronologically it becomes easier to spot patterns or trends. So, for example we can see that the team got off to a good start by
                    winning a majority of games, denoted by more green columns in the results section. As the season progressed we can see that results gradually declined and at a later
                    point in the season the manager was sacked - see if you can guess the moment at which this happened?! The three-dimensional layout of this data aids in the analysis,
                    even for relatively simple data such as this.
                </p>
                <h3>Customisation</h3>
                <p>
                    The vast majority of the visualisation can be customised. If you click on the Appearance section of the GUI on the right-hand side then you'll see a range
                    of options that can be configured. For instance the colour of each of the data attributes, the scale of the data and the additional labelling of all the
                    associated values (an example is shown below).
